## Purpose
If you deliver ChatGPT training videos (live or recorded) and your browser is full-screen, you know, subtitles or ads usually overlay the prompt.

The solution? Move the prompt to the center of the screen!

## Installation
1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) extension for your browser of choice (I only tested Safari on the Mac)
2. With your browser running, run Tampermonkey and create a new script
3. Replace the default code Tampermonkey creates with the code on my site
4. Save the Tampermonkey code

## Usage
1. Go to https://chatgpt.com
2. When the prompt is in focus (meaning you select the text area or it is already selected), it will display in the middle of the page with a colorful background so it stands out
3. Type your prompt and press enter/return on your keyboard (you can even use shift-enter for longer prompts!)
4. If the prompt box is in your way, select an area outside the box, and it will go back down to the bottom of the page where it exists by default
